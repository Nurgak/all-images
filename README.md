# All images

This repository hosts a simple script, written in JavaScript for the convenience of viewing, that generates every image possible within the provided resolution and color bit depth constraints.

![All images, 2x2, 1-bit, 1-channel](all-images_2x2_1b_1c.png)

Depending on the settings and iteration speed, the time to finish generating all the combinations might take more or less than the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe).

There is no point to it.

Enjoy.

## Usage

Set the resolution, color bit depth, color channels and hit run.

Example of a 3x3, 1-bit, 3-channel (RGB) image combinations (81 possibilities).
